### Native Instruments has announced that it is offering the [Analog Dreams](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/play-series/analog-dreams/?sscid=31k4_ighpw), for free until March 31st.

> Today, measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic are forcing much of the world into an unprecedented period of restriction, isolation, and uncertainty – with the music community hit particularly hard. Native Instruments wants to support the community through this time, and help people at home to be creative.

* Analog sounds from vintage synths of the ’70s, ’80s, and beyond
* Blended samples creatively processed to generate unique results
* Ready-to-go presets in a streamlined interface
* Part of the [Play Series](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/catalog/komplete/play-series/): Great-sounding presets and real-time control in an intuitive interface

this comes with more than 100 tweakable presets ranging from thick basses to dreamy pads, and usually retails for $49. It’s free until 31 March.

### In a statement, NI executives Daniel Haver and Mate Galic said:

> "These are challenging times for the global music community. 
“Cancellations, closures, and city lockdowns have hit artists and DJs particularly hard, with many people facing long periods of isolation. We are looking at ways we can support, and we encourage you to make the most of this time to connect with each other, learn new skills, and explore new sounds.
“That’s why we’re making Analog Dreams free until the end of March: A small gift to keep you inspired during all the extra home studio time. 
“Stay safe, look out for each other, and keep on creating."
