#### What is Ableton Live?

> Ableton Live lets you easily create, produce and perform music within one intuitive interface. Live keeps everything in sync and works in real-time, so you can play and modify your musical ideas without interrupting the creative flow.
Live comes with a versatile collection of instruments, sounds, kits and loops for creating any kind of music and provides a full complement of effects to tweak and process your sound.

The free trial period typically runs 30 days, but with the current coronavirus (COVID-19) quarantine there’s no better time to social distance yourself with your DAW (digital audio workstation).
