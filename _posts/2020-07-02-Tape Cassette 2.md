Caelum Audio publishes Tape Cassette 2, a new free tape saturation plugin (VST3/AU) and iOS app (AUv3) that emulates the warmth, noise, and character of old tape cassettes.

It’s not complete new but an updated version with sleek interface and more changes under the hood too. The Tape Cassette 2 features a brand new selectable Type 1 Cassette Impulse Response (IR), an improved saturation algorithm, wow & flutter engine, and implemented real sampled tape noise.

The results are nicely warm and more accurate vintage sound. In addition, it comes with two VU meters to monitor your audio as well as selectable oversampling. Pretty nice free update.
