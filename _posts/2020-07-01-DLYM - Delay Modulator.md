DLYM is a free ‘Delay Modulator’ plugin which produces flanger and chorus style effects using Imaginando’s powerful processing technology.
Taking inspiration from DRC’s chorus effect, DLYM expands on the functionality, and makes it available for DAW applications on PC, Mac and iOS for free!
Whether you’re looking to add just a touch of depth to your sounds or radically change them, DLYM can do both; we’ve even included over 20 presets/patches to get you started.
