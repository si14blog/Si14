“Bowed Glass Clouds” is a cinematic virtual instrument running in NI’s Kontakt. Its morphing pad engine creates rich, organic evolving textures with sounds sourced from bowed glass bowls and jars.

An Epic Cinematic Morphing Pad Instrument For Kontakt!
BOWED GLASS CLOUDS is a cinematic morphing pad instrument running in Kontakt 5.8 and above. It is based on recordings of bowed resonant glass bowls and jars, as well as a few selected sound design sources including a household hoover, and an Ebow-driven resonator guitar.
BOWED GLASS CLOUDS makes use of Kontakt’s AET Filter technology to seamlessly morph between layers of sound, both tonal and non-tonal. The instrument has a simple GUI allowing for controls for the morphing within each layer (A and B) as well as adjustment of balance between these layers.
Other controls include distortion, BP filter, delay and reverb as well as three-band parametric EQ.
