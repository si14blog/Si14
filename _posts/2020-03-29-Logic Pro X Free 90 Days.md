> Logic Pro is a digital audio workstation and MIDI sequencer software application for the macOS platform. It was originally created in the early 1990s as Notator Logic, or Logic, by German software developer C-Lab which later went by Emagic.

Apple has confirmed that, in light of current events, itâ€™s offering free 90-day access to its Logic Pro X Daw and Final Cut Pro X video editing application so that everyone can make music and edit videos for Free.

###### This is the first time a free trial of Logic Pro X has been available, though Apple say 
> once the 90 days are up, there'll be an ongoing 30-day free trial thereafter.
